# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17

# Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to apply machine learning to solve the challenge of credit card risk. Using the LendingClub provided credit card credit data set, oversampling, undersampling, a combination of over and undersampling (SMOTEENN) and reducing bias were used to predict credit risk.

# Results

* For the Naive Random Oversampling, the balanced accuracy score was 0.65. The high risk precision is 0.01 with a sensitivity of 0.60.

* For the SMOTE Oversampling, the balanced accuracy score was 0.64. The high risk precision is 0.01 with a sensitivity of 0.63.

* For the Undersampling, the balanced accuracy score was 0.64. The high risk precision is 0.01 with a sensitivity of 0.67.

*  For the Combination (Over and Under) Sampling,  the balanced accuracy score was 0.62. The high risk precision is 0.01 with a sensitivity of 0.70.

# Summary

It doesn't appear that the models used to perform the credit risk analysis are adequate at determining if credit risk is high.
